# some notes on these models

the various spheres i have created such as sun, earth, moon are a uv sphere in
blender with subdivided surfaces for a more round shape and then the uv mapped
image is applied to the sphere per the youtube tutorial i followed using NASA
public domain images.

the uv sphere is modeled with a radius of 1 (diameter of 2). this needs to be
taken into account when sizing the models in a scene.

the file in `assets/data/stellar_neighborhood.csv` contains data that can be
sized using this information.
